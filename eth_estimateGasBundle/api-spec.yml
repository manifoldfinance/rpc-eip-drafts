      summary: Simulate a bundle of transactions
      description: >
        Simulate a bundle of transactions at the top of a given block with the state of another
        (or the same) block. This can be used to simulate future blocks with the current state,
        or it can be used to simulate a past block. The sender is responsible for signing the
        transactions and using the correct nonce and ensuring validity.

      summary: Estimate gas for a bundle of transactions

        Estimate the gas required for executing a bundle of transactions without actually
        sending them to the network. This is useful for predicting gas usage and costs.
